## About
Office Oblitas Weingarten is a design-centric, network-driven practice where ideas are conceived, tested and refined into solutions for real-world challenges. We help founders, institutions and brands stand out—and stay relevant—in a highly competitive, hyper-connected world. OOW is based in Stockholm and works globally. Founded with the ambition to create beautiful, intelligent design, our work builds brands—either from the ground up or at moments when an outside, objective perspective is needed to address complex challenges. OOW creates brand worlds with meaningful distinctiveness for culture and commerce.

## Approach
Good design sits at the crossroads of function and beauty. It engages, compels and makes perfect sense—that’s what we strive to deliver for our clients. The journey should be revealing and inspiring, with strong relationships formed along the way. We observe and listen until we understand; only then do we immerse ourselves in the creative challenge. Our process seeks to unearth and express the intangible essence of a brand that people fall in love with. From behaviour to product, every company has a story—and design is the most powerful way to tell it. We like working with transparent people, open minds and good products. Thoughtfulness and care sit at the heart of our approach. Craft and rigour are the hallmarks of our output.

## Methodology
1. To think further and deeper, and go outside of expected norms.
2. To challenge the status quo with bold ideas that drive change through magic realism.
3. To create beautifully simple ideas to connect on an emotional level.
4. To commit, provide value and build authentic relationships that are propelled by a shared long-term vision.
